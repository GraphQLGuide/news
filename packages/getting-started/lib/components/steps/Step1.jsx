// Creating Routes

const text = `
Before we can move on to the next step, we need to create a **route** for it. 

In Vulcan, routes are created using the [addRoute](http://docs.vulcanjs.org/routing.html#Adding-Routes) function. 

Let's create a route for step 2. Open \`/lib/modules/routes.js\`, find the route named \`step2\`, and uncomment that line. Once you save the file, this page should automatically reload. 

You'll notice that the route points to a component named \`Step2\`, which we've already registered. But more on that very soon!
`;

const after = `
Well done, you've beaten level 1!

By the way, when developing locally you can review all your routes using the [Routes dashboard](/routes), if you have the [debug package](http://docs.vulcanjs.org/debug.html) enabled. You can use it anytime to double-check if a route is properly enabled, though I trust you won't use it to cheat and get ahead in the tutorialâ€¦

const Step1 = () => <Components.Step step={1} text={text} after={after}/>;

registerComponent({ name: 'Step1', component: Step1 });
